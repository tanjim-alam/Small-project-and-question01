Execution context is an essential concept in JavaScript that defines the environment in which code is executed.
It consists of various components that enable the interpretation and execution of JavaScript code. Understanding
execution context is crucial for understanding how JavaScript code is executed.

An execution context can be thought of as a wrapper that contains the code being executed
and provides access to variables, functions, and other resources. Each time a function is called or
code is executed globally, a new execution context is created.
