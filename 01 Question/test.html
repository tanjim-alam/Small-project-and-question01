1. Static
The default position value for elements is static,
where they are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

<div class="box">
  This is a static position element.
</div>

<!-- ==================== -->

2. Fixed
Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport
and remain fixed even when the page is scrolled.

<div class="box" style="position: fixed; top: 20px; right: 20px;">
  This is a fixed position element.
</div>

<!-- ===================== -->

3. Sticky
Elements with position: sticky are positioned based on the normal
flow of the document until a specified scroll position is reached.
Then, they become "sticky" and remain fixed in that position.

<div class="box" style="position: sticky; top: 20px;">
  This is a sticky position element.
</div>

<!-- ===================== -->

4. Relative
Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal
position in the document flow. Adjusting the top, bottom, left, or right
properties can move them from their original position.

<div class="box" style="position: relative; left: 20px; top: 10px;">
  This is a relative position element.
</div>

<!-- ========================= -->


5. Absolute
Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to the nearest
positioned ancestor (an element with a position value other than static) or
the containing block. They are taken out of the normal flow and can overlap other elements.

<div class="container" style="position: relative;">
  <div class="box" style="position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 50px;">
    This is an absolute position element.
  </div>
</div>
